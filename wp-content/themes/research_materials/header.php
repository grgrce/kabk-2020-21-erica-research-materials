	<p>The 60-day Nagorno Karabakh conflict this past September-November was an old wound ripped open that just keeps on bleeding. This conflict in the mountainous heights of Karabakh, which dates back to 1988, is of an ethnic territorial nature. It pits the aspirations of the Armenian-majority region of Nagorny Karabakh for self-determination against Azerbaijan’s right to the territory under international law. Almost incapable of dialogue, both sides have sought to settle their dispute by force of arms. In the ’90s, the Armenian side prevailed at great cost. Since then, Nagorno-Karabakh has remained part of Azerbaijan but is controlled by separatist ethnic Armenians backed by the Armenian government. Until recently, negotiations mediated by international powers had failed to deliver a peace agreement.
	on Sept. 27 2020, Azerbaijan took military action to reverse that defeat and recover lost lands. 
	Ingredients in the conflict are the fight for self-determination, centuries old cultural heritage, religion: ARM is majority Christian vs AZ majority Muslim, but the NK conflict also functions as a pion of international relations of the region: Turkey has close ties to AZ, while Russia is allied with ARM etc etc</p>
	<p>Is information warfare deadlier these days than actual fighting with guns and bullets? If we look at the NK conflict, one might say so. 

	State media of both ARM and AZ represent entirely different (absolutist narratives) versions of what had happened and why. News is used as a tool for state propaganda rather than for the purpose of informing the people.  The conflict is depicted as an absolutist narrative about winners and loser, that continues to pervade these societies and doesn’t allow for reflection and thus true resolution of the deeper roots of the conflict. Independent media -that does not serve the purpose of state propaganda- is not allowed near the frontline – only pro state media is – which makes independent information from the frontline nonexistent and thus journalistic investigation during the war nearly impossible. 

	<p>The competing narratives have created a poisonous environment in which any middle ground is simply drowned out. "There's a very toxic information war going on, particularly on social media that I think is aimed not just at the other side but also at intimidating anyone with a message that favors peace," or indeed more nuanced histories, says De Waal. "That's obviously dangerous because it makes it harder to find compromise."</p>

	<p>As fighting raged between AZ and ARM, an intense propaganda war was being waged for the moral high ground, boosted by AZ oil revenues, social media and ARM large and vocal diaspora.</p>

	<p>An unresolved conflict, even when there’s no active fighting, gnaws at the fiber of a society from within: there is an intangible toxic effect of war on political discourse and the media, the way it renders a society incapable of looking at the future, while it dwells on the past. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan are being sapped by these ghosts. Both sides still harbor a lot of unchanneled aggression and historical pain and trauma. When looking at reporting this is of big importance: in the process of producing and receiving information/media, especially in times of war, emotion and trauma play an important role; not only does it distort information, or color the informational needs heavily, modern media platforms are growingly emotionalized. </p>
	<p>There is a term in journalism ‘wartales’ for those instances in which people believe and have even seen an event with their own eyes, whilst it has never happened.

	( we can’t blame the people to rely heavily on social media as a source as they the national new is corrupt and as they are familiar with a culture wherein information is extracted and spread via social networks. ) 

	Social media in NK conflict is used way more as a source of information than independent journalistic platforms like JAM news which increases the risk of misinformation and has deep affects on the emotionality of information (undermining to the informational potential of media). Social media has an emotion-centric design and commercial orientation: our attention is commanded to sell our data to clients who want to sell things. media that focuses on making you feel things, serves a different motivation from informing people for their understanding of the world. Even if the two are not strictly mutually exclusive, they are very different priorities. Indeed, misinformation can be far more engaging.
